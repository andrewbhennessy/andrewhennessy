##QuickBrush
1. I got the commission by pure happenstance when an individual was curious about my design knowledge while using a 3D printer at a local home depot. He asked me to visit his shop and let him explain what he wanted to manufacture and me having my summer in front of me and a inevtiably failing other project I decided to just go for it. 
2. I drew on my design skills, 3D printing skills, and skills I had learned from building my airplane and knowledge of manufactuing. 
3. I was proud of my ability to bridge a cultural gap with an urban Entrepreneur. I also felt like a fish out of water, but we were bounded together by a desire to produce a product.
