##Cognosos
1. I was offered the position by the founder because he was impressed by my knowledge about his technology while in a meeting related to the product but unreleated to me that I was sitting in on.  
2. My Role was developing a prototype for a trial and showing clients the technology before the manufactured model would be maade. 
3. I Learned how to effectively find work and complete it in an order that was most effective to the overall goal of everyone else.
