##Aerial Foundry
1. I designed this project because I was fascinated by flight and automating it. I thought it was an amazing idea to bring highly sophisticated technologys to a civilian context
2. Other than buying the plane everything else was built by me and the installation of the electronics, airspeed pitot tube, gps and compass, and flight computer.
3. I learned you can fail miserably and the value of learning from failure is more than the completion of the project itself.
