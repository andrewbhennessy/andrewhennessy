##CoxBox
1. I Designed this because I found the need to create something for rowers and crews that had never been built. The products currently being used were milestones behind current technology and I saw to update it. 
2. I spent countless hours designing testing and getting the parts to manufacture and build a prototype for the CoxBox. 
3. The skills that were required to create this were:
  1. 3D Printing
  2. Autodesk 360 CAD/CAM
  3. Electrical Knowledge
  4. Rowing knowledge
  5. Waterproofing Knowledge and Expertise
