##Factum Arte
1. I Got the Position Through my Brothers Friend who heard about the things I do at home and suggested that I look after a position. I repeatedly haggled the proprietor but he repeatedly turned me down until he just gave up. 
2. I was in charge of programming the scanning device in order for it to interface between hardware and software. I also was in charge of designing and creating the prescsion timing mechanism to take the photos. Furthermore, I helped in every other position to troubleshoot and get the scanner off the ground. 
3. I learned how to work in a collabrative group with others who have different interestes, first language profeciancy, and skillsets. I used this knowledge to significantly propel the project off the ground and more quickly to completion.
