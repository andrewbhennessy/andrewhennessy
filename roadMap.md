##Factum Arte
1. I Got the Position Through my Brothers Friend who heard about the things I do at home and suggested that I look after a position. I repeatedly haggled the proprietor but he repeatedly turned me down until he just gave up. 
2. I was in charge of programming the scanning device in order for it to interface between hardware and software. I also was in charge of designing and creating the prescsion timing mechanism to take the photos. Furthermore, I helped in every other position to troubleshoot and get the scanner off the ground. 
3. I learned how to work in a collabrative group with others who have different interestes, first language profeciancy, and skillsets. I used this knowledge to significantly propel the project off the ground and more quickly to completion.

##Cognosos
1. I was offered the position by the founder because he was impressed by my knowledge about his technology while in a meeting related to the product but unreleated to me that I was sitting in on.  
2. My Role was developing a prototype for a trial and showing clients the technology before the manufactured model would be maade. 
3. I Learned how to effectively find work and complete it in an order that was most effective to the overall goal of everyone else.

##CoxBox
1. I Designed this because I found the need to create something for rowers and crews that had never been built. The products currently being used were milestones behind current technology and I saw to update it. 
2. I spent countless hours designing testing and getting the parts to manufacture and build a prototype for the CoxBox. 
3. The skills that were required to create this were:
  1. 3D Printing
  2. Autodesk 360 CAD/CAM
  3. Electrical Knowledge
  4. Rowing knowledge
  5. Waterproofing Knowledge and Expertise

##Aerial Foundry
1. I designed this project because I was fascinated by flight and automating it. I thought it was an amazing idea to bring highly sophisticated technologys to a civilian context
2. Other than buying the plane everything else was built by me and the installation of the electronics, airspeed pitot tube, gps and compass, and flight computer.
3. I learned you can fail miserably and the value of learning from failure is more than the completion of the project itself.

##QuickBrush
1. I got the commission by pure happenstance when an individual was curious about my design knowledge while using a 3D printer at a local home depot. He asked me to visit his shop and let him explain what he wanted to manufacture and me having my summer in front of me and a inevtiably failing other project I decided to just go for it. 
2. I drew on my design skills, 3D printing skills, and skills I had learned from building my airplane and knowledge of manufactuing. 
3. I was proud of my ability to bridge a cultural gap with an urban Entrepreneur. I also felt like a fish out of water, but we were bounded together by a desire to produce a product.
